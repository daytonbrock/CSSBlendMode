# CSSBlendMode

I decide to take a look at blend mode in CSS for my show and tell homework. Blend mode allows you to access different layering methods from Photoshop in CSS to quickly and easily blend an image with a color or even another image. This is a popular way to style websites right now -- Spotify uses this really well. 

Couple resources I looked at:
